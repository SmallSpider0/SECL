# SECL

- **eval1_mo_utility**
  - Determine the utility function of the model owner through experiments.

- **eval2_incentives**
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of Contract Theory-based incentive mechanisms, including whether the designed contracts are feasible, i.e., satisfying Monotonicity, Incentive Compatibility (IC), and Individual Rationality (IR). Also, assess whether they can effectively tolerate information asymmetry.

- **eval3_end_to_end**
  - Evaluate the robustness of SECL's submission verification method against malicious trainers and compare it with four widely adopted methods ("Acc" is based on the test accuracy of local models, "Shap" uses Shapley values to measure contribution, "Inful" measures the contribution of local models to the global model's loss, and "MK" is based on the multi-KRUM algorithm).

- **eval4_reputation**
  - Assess the effectiveness of the Adaptive Committee Formation Algorithm, including the evaluation of reputation values and the construction of verification committees based on reputation.
